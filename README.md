I made a little box with 10 Buttons in 5 different colors (two of each), driven by a Raspberry Pi 3 for my little son - as he loves to press buttons.
And also because I just wanted to play around with the Raspberry Pi and I now have a good reason to do so :)

# Nerd-Fact
The cardboard box I'm using came with a Ubiquity Networks UAP-AC-PRO I bought some weeks ago. Perfect match as it's hopefully strong enough to withstand the forces of my son and small enough so that he might carry it around easily.
